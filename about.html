        <h1>About The Project</h1>
        <p>
            The research project was instigated in 2014 following
            the purchase of “Outwood”, a Grade II listed building, by
            St. Anselm’s College Edmund Rice Trust in 2011, prompted
            by connections with the Dome of Home, New Brighton,
            where a similar project was being undertaken.
        </p>
        <div>
            The Project’s aims include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Providing opportunities for young people to engage in and
                    share heritage awareness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bringing local youth and heritage and the community into
                    a harmonious relationship, stimulating awareness of, and fresh
                    attitudes to, heritage and history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preparing documented records – printed and DVDs - of the
                    origins and history of Outwood and the Claughton
                    neighbourhood, along with subsequent events, discovered
                    through historical and heritage research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sharing these experiences with the local wider community
                    through a programme of inter-active and inter-personal social
                    and cultural events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Digitisation of documents and photographs and the
                    creation of a dedicated website making information widely
                    available to all.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            All that was known from the sale brochure was that
            the Christian Brothers had bought Outwood, a Grade II
            listed building, from the Heap family in 1931. “Outwood
            House was built in approximately 1860 and is understood
            to have been the family home of the Heap family, famous
            grain merchants based in Merseyside.” (Edward Symmons,
            December 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
            A grant of £2,500 had been obtained from the
            Community Development Foundation. An Application was
            made to Heritage Lottery Fund in order to expand the
            perimeters of the exercise. Under their Young Roots
            programme, a grant of £18,000 was approved, with Wirral
            History and Heritage Association as our Heritage Partners.
            The Edmund Rice Trust would provide the balance of the
            overall cost of £25,530.
        </p>
        <p>
            Little was it realised that we were embarking on a
            story with a profound and broad tapestry; one which had
            an extensive background of affluent and influential
            families extending throughout the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first task was to research the Heap family. It was
            soon discovered the family name was quite famous with
            many records available. There are descendants in
            Australia who have provided access to a very large family
            pedigree going back to Robert de Hep 1170. Contact was
            made with relations in North Wales and the students and
            leaders have visited them. The family members were able
            to provide much detailed information about their
            ancestors. They very kindly loaned us a copy of the private
            family history, “Records of the Family of Heape”, one of
            only five, which had been researched by family members
            and printed in 1904.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contrary to what we originally understood, it has
            been ascertained that Outwood was built for Halsall Segar
            and his wife, Catherine, who laid the foundation stone in
            1862.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Segars are also from a long-established heritage
            with much family history being readily available. We have
            made contact with a number of Segar descendants from
            whom we have obtained various family tree lineages.
            These track ancestry deriving from King William the
            Conqueror, and King John Plantagenet. The families have
            kindly supplied plentiful family records including The Story
            of My life by Catherine Segar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students and Staff have been delighted to welcome
            descendants of both the Segar and Heap families on their
            recent visits to Outwood.
        </p>
        <p>
            And all of the above before we even touch the more
            recent history resulting from sale of Outwood in 1931 by
            Joseph Heap. The further narration tells of a whole new
            story-line: The Christian Brothers and the College; Saint
            Anselm and Blessed Edmund Rice; 15 Head Teachers,
            hundreds of staff and thousands of students; and a
            multitude of activities and outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the limited time and facilities available, Society
            members have unearthed a mountain of information, a
            plethora of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would surely take a team of dedicated historians a
            number of years to present in a compendium the consolidated
            story of all the users and usages of Outwood House.
