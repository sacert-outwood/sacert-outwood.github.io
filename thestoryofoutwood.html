        <h2 id="the-outwood-story">The Outwood Story</h2>
        <p>
            The site of Outwood was part of the original estate of Birkenhead Priory. Following the Dissolution of the
            Monasteries it passed through a series of families: Worsley, Powell, Cleveland and Price. By the early 19th
            century it was in the hands of Francis Richard Price. A map of the Price estate, surveyed in 1823, can be seen
            in Wirral Archives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Price sold the land to William Jackson. By the time of the Tithe Maps 1835 –1861 (see on line on emapping Victorian Cheshire) the site is shown as owned by William Jackson and was all but a section of the
            plot described as building land.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outwood House is a large detached villa of an
            Italianate neo-classical style. Built from Storeton
            sandstone in 1862, it is mightily impressive and
            one of the few remaining Claughton mansions in
            what was then a most exclusive area. Grade II
            listed in March 1974, Outwood is now home to
            St. Anselm's College Sixth Form community. The
            building boasts a chequered history of over a
            century and a half, serving at various points as a
            stately home, school house and residency for the
            Christian Brothers, and currently as a Sixth Form
            Centre. Although Outwood's function may have
            varied over the years, its architectural splendour
            has remained an indubitable constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outwood was a structure built to impress as
            the property's opulent entrance and surrounding
            walls make clear. The formal entrance gates,
            which are separately Grade II listed and situated at
            the corner of Egerton Road and Manor Hill, bear
            four gas fittings, each decorated with an imposing
            dragon design. Connected to these gates are
            heavily rusticated walls with square balusters that
            provide the property with a grandeur and privacy
            befitting a building of such prominent status.
            Inside the walls are the property's substantial
            grounds, measuring around 3.64 acres, part of
            which are still maintained as gardens, as was
            originally intended. However, most of the land is
            now occupied by the buildings of St. Anselm's
            College, an all-boys’ Catholic secondary school
            founded in 1933.
        </p>
        <p>
            On entering the property grounds, one climbs
            a sweeping path in order to reach Outwood, which
            was built on rising land. This natural elevation,
            combined with the exposure of the basement
            level on two sides, lends Outwood a grandiose
            impression exceeding its two storied height.
            The attic
            level, topped by a medium pitched, Welsh slate roof with
            a large overhang, completes the building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing outside the north faĉade of Outwood, the
            eye is drawn to the changing nature of the exterior
            stonework. The base is rusticated upwards until the first
            floor, from which point the stone gains a smooth and
            polished finish. This view is also eye catching because of
            the magnificent bay window of the ground floor dining
            room and the broken pediment that frames the windows
            on the floor above. In the 19th century, the building's first
            visitors would have taken in such sights before alighting
            from horse-drawn carriages at the porch. Adjacent to the
            porch was a turning circle for coaches and inside the
            grounds there were stables and coach house facilities.
            The porch itself is enclosed by Tuscan pilasters and bears
            an open balustrade flat roof.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the rear of the house is a large orangery, which
            would have been heated by the boiler room immediately
            below. The extensive gardens were laced with footpaths
            weaving through the trees and around the lily pond in the
            lower grounds. Fruit and vegetables were grown in the
            orangery and in the gardens and the many greenhouses.
        </p>
        <p>
            When in the presence of Outwood House, one cannot
            help but be aware of this building's historic nature.
            Proceeding towards the porch for access to the interior,
            images of the past intermingle with the present.
            Therefore, before moving onto an examination of the
            Outwood interior, it is helpful to introduce the first
            inhabitants of Outwood, the Segar and Heap families, so
            that we can get an insight into what life was like in the
            early years of Outwood House.

        <p>
            Halsall Segar is the reason Outwood House exists. In
            1862, he purchased the grounds from William Jackson,
            owner of Claughton Manor, another substantial mansion,
            that unfortunately no longer exists. Segar paid for the
            construction of Outwood House with the intention of
            making it the family residence for himself, his wife
            Catherine, and his seven children. Thus began the history
            of this spectacular landmark that stands so prominently in
            the heart of Birkenhead.
        </p>
        <p>
            J. Hockey, The Old Mansions of Birkenhead in
            Birkenhead History Society Newsletter, No.85 in August
            2000, p.3
            2 Grade II Listing, English Heritage building ID: 389188,
            March 1974
        </p>
        <p>
            In the summer of 1862, Catherine Segar laid the
            foundation stone. About that occasion, she writes, 'A
            stone was laid in July. My dear husband had a number of
            Bibles placed on the stone, and he gave one to each of the
            workmen employed at "Outwood", who wished to have
            one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Segars moved into the building in 1863. Though
            the family were not in the house during a census, we
            know that domestic servants, including a cook and a
            coach driver, were on hand to help with the running of
            the house. This is evident not only in Catherine's memoirs
            but in the construction of the house, which included
            servant quarters and a separate staircase system. In 1867,
            the Segar family moved to Hoylake whilst Outwood House
            was painted and papered, but the following year, the
            family reluctantly left Outwood for good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to Halsall’s failing health, the Segars moved to
            Huyton in 1868, selling Outwood in 1872. It was a
            devastating blow for the Segars to leave Outwood House
            so soon after purchasing. Catherine Segar writes, 'I was so
            fond of the place that I could not bear the thought of
            leaving it...it was so painful to me…but as Halsall wished
            it, I would not oppose it; his health was of paramount
            importance. Alas, their premature exit in 1868 was
            forced by the respiratory problems that had plagued
            Halsall Segar for years. John Hubback, Halsall's colleague,
            writes, 'the crossing by boat was too severe a strain for
            his invalid condition and they moved to The Grove,
            Huyton, where he died in 1873.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outwood became a burden upon the family. Too
            large and costly to maintain in absentia, the Segars felt
            compelled to sell as quickly as possible. With some
            disappointment, Catherine recalls, 'We sold Outwood a
            few years later for less than half it had cost us, but as it
            was a constant expense, we felt it better to part with it
            even on these terms than keep it any longer.'6 It was a
            crushing blow for Catherine not only because she was so
            fond of the house, and wished to sell it at full value, but
            also because her social life was so interwoven with the
            surrounding area. She knew nobody in Huyton, she had to
            start again. Of this dislocation, she writes 'I felt the
            removal from Birkenhead very much more, I think, than
            anyone imagined. I left so many intimate friends there,
            and felt such a stranger at Huyton.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-heaps-at-outwood">The Heaps at Outwood</h3>
        <p>
            Joshua Milne Heap was the second man to own and
            inhabit Outwood House. His purchase in 1872 marked the
            beginning of the Heap family tenure of Outwood. All in all,
            three generations of the family would occupy the
            building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally a family of Liverpool-and Rochdale-based
            grocers, the Heaps made their fortune through the
            importing and treatment of rice, sugar and flour. Joshua
            Milne Heap, along with his brother, Richard Rankin Heap,
            ran the family business, Joseph Heap & Sons, which was
            passed down by their father, Joshua Heap. The business
            was primarily based in Liverpool, the main offices being
            situated on Dale Street and the Temple, with a sugar
            house in Beckwith Street and the rice mill on UpperPownall Street, which still stands today. An extremely
            profitable business, it enabled Joshua Milne Heap to
            purchase Outwood House, from which the Heap Rice Mill
            is still visible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1871 census, Outwood House is unoccupied;
            the Heaps were yet to purchase the building and the
            Segars had relocated to Huyton. At this point, the Heaps
            were still living in Lancashire. However, they had certainly
            moved into Outwood by 1874, as, in the September of
            that year, the family placed an advert in the Liverpool
            6 Catherine E. Segar, Story of my Life, p. 39 7 Catherine E. Segar, Story of my Life, p. 40
            Mercury in order to secure the services of a 'very good
            plain cook' at Outwood House.
        </p>
        <p>
            A census recorded in 1881, sheds some light on what
            life was like in Outwood House under Joshua Milne Heap.
            Out of the 16 people recorded on the census, seven were
            servants and one a governess, indicating how labourintensive the running of such a large household really
            was; it was a full time operation. All eight domestic staff
            were female, their ages ranging from 20 to the
            governess's 51. Only one of the domestic staff came from
            the Merseyside area, the rest had relocated to Birkenhead
            from all over the British Isles, originating from diverse
            places ranging from Scotland to Sussex. In joining the
            security of the Heap's household, and in ensuring their
            employers’ well-to-do lifestyle was maintained, the
            domestic staff effectively sacrificed the opportunity to
            have their own family and private lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Joshua Milne Heap died in 1890 and Outwood passed
            to the only son among his 10 children, Joseph Heap.
            Described in the Liverpool Legion of Honour as 'a
            prominent figure in the best Birkenhead society
            , Joseph
            opted to retire from business in 1892 in his mid-thirties.
            It was the same Joseph Heap who sold his shares in
            the family company that would sell Outwood House to
            the Christian Brothers in 1931. Before this, however, he
            raised his own family in Outwood. Joseph's son, Joseph
            Milne Heap was born in 1899. Having entered Rugby
            School in 1901, he would go on to serve in the air services
            from 1912 to 1920.
        </p>
        <h3>Inside Outwood House</h3>
        <p>
            Although formidable from the outside, the true
            essence of Outwood House is only appreciated when one
            encounters the grandeur of the ground floor. Due to
            Outwood being largely unaltered since the Christian
            Brothers purchased the building, we are able to
            accurately imagine what domestic life would have
            entailed for the Segars and the Heaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, there is the entrance vestibule. With a barrelshaped ceiling and panelled with gold-tinged mahogany,
            the vestibule assures guests, past and present, that the
            inside of Outwood is a match for the outside. Once past
            the vestibule's glazed double doors, with their original
            glass and brass fittings, the central hall lies in wait. In
            stark contrast to the cloistered envelope of the vestibule,
            the central hall is suddenly vast and acts as a receptacle
            for natural light thanks to the glazed skylight. The light
            8 B. Guinness Orchard, Liverpool's Legion of Honour, vol. 2,
            (published by author, 72 Bridge Street, 1893),
            and openness of the hall can be attributed to the wide
            three-flight staircase that snakes around the wall,
            allowing for a first floor cantilevered landing, in turn
            enabling the acid-etched skylight to have its intended
            effect. The sunflower pattern on the central hall wall
            derives from a major refurbishment that took place under
            the Heaps in 1905.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the ground floor there is the study with fitted oak
            bookshelves and cabinets where both Halsall Segar and
            the Heaps would have written their daily correspondence.
            Next to this is the dining room in which a large sideboard
            fitted with original mirrors lengthens the space
            considerably. There is an oak fireplace surround adorned
            with neo-classical gaslight figureheads. A connecting door
            to the servants’ area gave domestic staff easy access to
            the kitchens when serving meals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The morning room also boasts a fireplace of note and
            it can be dated to the Edwardian period. Used as the
            headmaster's office when Outwood was converted into a
            school in the 1930s, the morning room is airy with oak
            parquet flooring and a frieze with inbuilt ventilation. This
            ventilation system ensured that heat from the boiler,
            which was located in the basement, filtered through the
            rest of the house. Situated in the basement were the
            smoking and billiard rooms for evening respite, though
            few architectural traces of these rooms remain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest of all the ground floor's offerings is the
            drawing room. Accessed through a double-sided door, it
            once housed an Aeolian pipe organ during the Heap
            tenure, in addition to providing plenty of space for chairs,
            there is a window screen with accompanying upholstered
            velvet seating and a fireplace-surround. Note the handmade copper light fixtures and copper bell handles used
            to summon domestic staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            The higher one goes in Outwood House, the less
            impressive the interior architecture. This aesthetic decline
            is a case of both pragmatism and deliberate design. On
            one hand, it would have been very costly to furnish and
            design all the floors to the standard of the ground floor.
            On the other hand, the attic floor was built to house
            domestic staff, and so the inferior features of that area
            were a purposeful means of distinction. In the comparably
            cramped staircase and low doorways of the
            servants’ wing came the constant reminder of
            the domestic staff's lower status.

            However, the quality of the first floor ensures that
            any architectural wane is a gradual one. The master and
            guest bedrooms on the first floor were constructed to a
            high standard, if not quite as high as the ground floor, and
            the rope motif plasterwork on the landing, added in 1905,
            is not without charm. The guest room, which would have
            also served interchangeably as a ladies dressing room, has
            particularly fine detail in the column between two sash
            windows overlooking the gardens. Here, decorative plates
            would have almost certainly been hung.

            Architecturally preserved, Outwood today lacks the
            multitude of fine objects that would have filled the house
            during the Heap and Segar eras; ostentatious, almost
            cluttered, displays were customary for upper-middle-class
            Victorians.

            The Corkhill & Job catalogue for the second auction,
            dated from 30th November to 3rd December 1931, when
            Joseph Heap was selling the ‘remaining portion of
            antiques and modern household appointments’, strongly
            suggests that Outwood was a treasure trove, brimming
            with rare and exotic items, exampled in the photographs
            of the Aeolian pipe organ in the Drawing Room,
            elsewhere in this book. In order to discover the source of
            such material wealth, one must turn to the business
            interests of both the Segar and Heap families.
