        <h2 id="st-anselms-college">St. Anselm's College</h2>
        <p>
            St Anselm’s College opened to the first pupils in
            September 1933. Headmaster Brother McDonald
            had written to parents, “The College will open on
            Monday September 18th at 9.00am, as by that date
            the building work will be sufficiently complete.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The first three pupils thought to be recorded
            were Gary Anderson, Ivor Winder and Kenneth
            Nolan. Brother MacDonald was the first Headmaster
            with Brothers G. D. O'Donoghue, Peter Thomas and
            Aidan Sexton making up the first community. Sixtythree pupils were in attendance when the school
            was officially opened on 18th September 1933. John
            Marmion also joined on that day, though he insists
            he was in the Prep School.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to this, there was no Catholic Grammar
            school for boys on the Wirral side of the River
            Mersey. The only two schools available for boys
            requiring a Catholic grammar-school education were
            St. Edward's (formerly the 'Catholic Institute') Hope
            Street, Liverpool, run by the Christian Brothers (later
            moving to Sandfield Park as their numbers
            increased) and St. Francis Xavier's, staffed by the
            Jesuits. There was a further Christian Brother school
            in Crosby, St. Mary’s.
        </p>
        <p>
            In June 1931, the Head of St Edward's–Brother
            Stanislaw Roche received an appeal concerning such
            an issue from the Parish Priest of St. Joseph's,
            Birkenhead, the Very Reverend Provost Hazlehurst.
            With the appeal was an offer of £10,000 from the
            Shrewsbury Diocese for the building of a school and
            the buying of a house near Birkenhead Park which it
            was agreed could accommodate all the area’s
            interests. The 'Go Ahead' was given by the Superior
            General of the Christian Brothers in the hope that a
            school would be running within three years.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 18th August 1931, Brother Roche was
            informed by V. Rev. Hazlehurst that a suitable site
            had been found: a large house called 'Outwood' with
            3.64 acres for the price of £4,200. The house had
            been built in 1862 by a Mr Halsall Segar. In 1871 a
            wealthy merchant named Joshua Milne Heap
            purchased it and on his death left it to his son,
            Joseph. As the years passed, the house proved too
            expensive to maintain and was sold. Builders, D.
            Evans and Son, bought the property just before 1931
            for £3,400. The purchase was not quite completed
            when the Christian Brothers' solicitor offered
            £3,000. Nothing below £4,000 was even considered.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 4th January 1932, the sale was completed for
            £4,200. The letter of completion is dated 9th January
            and as 'Outwood' became Christian Brother
            property, the diocese promptly sent £2,000.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Mr William Ellis of St Helens was appointed
            architect for the new school building. The overall
            plan, despite the comment that there was enough
            recreational space but insufficient 'sporting area',
            was met with approval by the Ministry of Education.
            Of the 12 estimates for the building, a Mr C. J.
            Doyle (who built the crypt for the original design of
            Liverpool's Catholic Cathedral, prior to Cardinal
            Heenan) offered what seemed to be the best price.
            Since that was subsequently modified, a Mr Fleming
            of Neston was awarded the contract with his
            estimate of £16,445.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the Diocese urging prompt action, the
            contract was signed on 7th January 1933 and work
            was begun on the 11th January. The builders, whose
            foreman was a Mr Harry Oxton, were noted for
            being 'worthy contractors' and although their work
            took them through to January 1934 the Brothers
            opened the school in September 1933.
        </p>
        <p>
            With pupil numbers increasing to 113 in
            September 1934 some forms shared a classroom;
            e.g. the six pupils of the 'Prep class' and 11 of Form
            One were taught in one room with two masters.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1936 a new Head, Brother Thompson arrived.
            The original school motto was “Omnia probate
            quod bonum est tenate” meaning “try everything
            then hold on to that which is best.” This was later
            changed to “Fides quarens intellectum”, taken from
            the writings of St. Anselm, which translates as “the
            Faith to seek better what it already believes” and the
            uniform from brown and yellow to blue and gold.
            Brother Thompson also introduced the House
            system, starting off with Outwood (-yellow) and
            Manor (-blue.) He also introduced the STRAP, which
            many Anselmians may well remember!
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1937 Bob Stevenson (Science) and Joe Furlong
            (French) were appointed followed by Miss Magee
            (Music) in 1938.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first Inspection by H M Board of Education
            was held at the end of March 1938.
            The 12-page Report states that there were 183
            pupils of which 44% were from Birkenhead, 30%
            from Wallasey and the remaining 26% from Cheshire
            and as far as Chester. There were nine full-time staff
            ST ANSELM’S COLLEGE
            21
            including the Headmaster and seven visiting staff.
            Tuition fees were £12 guineas per year. Since
            opening, 21 Free Places has been awarded.
            The original plans were to accommodate 430
            pupils. It was noted that “There is no supply of hot
            water available for the use of the boys.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Comment was made of the youthfulness of the
            teaching Staff; “Only two of the regular staff are
            more than 25 years of age” but adds “They are,
            without exception, enthusiastic and hardworking,
            and class control is good”. There are reports over 10
            main headings, and detailed comments on the 11
            faculties.
        </p>
        <h2 id="st-anselm">St. Anselm</h2>
        <p>
            Monk, theologian, Archbishop of Canterbury, doctor of the church and one of the four fathers of scholasticism:
            This is, by his most famous title, Saint Anselm of Canterbury (Latin: Anselmus Cantuariensis)
        </p>
        <p>
            He was born
            ‘Anselmo’ in April 1033 in
            Aosta, now part of
            Northern Italy; son to
            wealthy parents Gundulf
            and Ermenberg. It is most
            likely that Anselm
            inherited his wealth,
            status, and scholarly
            attributes from his family,
            this being rather
            prestigious with links to
            the ancient Lombards and
            ties to powerful
            figureheads such as Conrad I of Burgundy as well as the
            Holy Roman Emperor Henry II.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, the young Anselm was heavily
            influenced by his mother's piety, having had him
            installed in a school of learning at an early age,
            understanding his premature desires to join the clerical
            profession. It is obvious, from only a brief investigation
            into the early life of the saint, that he had a premature
            passion, an infatuation, towards the Church. This can
            be clearly seen in his attempt to join a monastery at
            the age of 15; this was refused on account of his
            father’s displeasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, most probably as a direct consequence of his
            father’s dissent, it can be noted that Anselm
            underwent a brief period of psychosomatic illness
            which was only relieved by a complete abandonment
            of his studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the new youthful spirit created by this
            carefree lifestyle did not last long; in the year 1056, at
            the age of 23, his mother passed away. The resulting
            grief and distress caused by his wife’s death and only
            son’s wishes to become a monk sank Anselm’s father,
            Gundulf, into a deep anger and depression. Unable to
            stand his father’s emotions, Anselm left Aosta in search
            of a new life.
        </p>
        <p>
            For three years Anselm ventured through Burgundy
            and France, with the aim to reach his famed fellow
            countryman Lanfranc of Pavia who was Prior at the
            Benedictine abbey of Bec. Arriving in 1059, the year
            before his father’s death, Anselm was instructed by
            Lanfranc to concentrate on his faith and enter into a
            novitiate under Maurilius, the Norman Archbishop of
            Rouen. It was during this period in which Anselm
            penned his first philosophical work: the ‘Grammarian’.
            Subsequent to the Norman conquest of Britain in
            1066, the Abbey of Bec was given gratuitous amounts of land in England.
            This allowed the abbot, Anselm, to
            visit the country occasionally in order to oversee its
            acquired property. On these occasions Anselm was also
            summoned to wait on England’s sovereign, William the
            Conqueror, and visited Lanfranc, who was then
            Archbishop of Canterbury. Thus, it was due to his
            strong relationship with King William I and the
            Archbishop that Anselm quickly became the favourite
            to be the successor of Lanfranc. However, fate would
            not be kind, for when it was time to take on this
            position at the event of Lanfranc’s death in 1089 the
            English ruling monarch had been replaced by William
            Rufus. Notorious for his outright selfishness, Rufus
            appropriated the Church’s land and finances for
            himself and refused the appointment of any successor
            to the Archbishop. Moreover, by the time William II
            wished to confess for his sinful behaviour, Anselm had
            become ill, he did not wish to fulfil the position of
            Archbishop fearing old age, weakness and contention
            from the monks at Bec. Still, many wanted the elderly
            abbot to attain the position, and on the 25th of
            September 1093 Anselm was enthroned as Archbishop
            of Canterbury.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anselm was
            therefore elected
            Archbishop of
            Canterbury in 1093.
            King William’s opinion
            of appointing someone
            to the See of
            Canterbury changed
            with his sudden illness.
            Prior to this he had
            been enjoying the
            See’s revenues.
            Between 1095 and
            1098 Anselm published
            his famous works of
            Cur Deus Homo? ("Why God was a Man?") This was a
            response to arguments on the subject of Christ’s
            incarnation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1097, during his first period in exile, Anselm
            went to Rome. King William II supposedly demanded
            Anselm to pay 1,000 marks as the price of his
            nomination to the See of Canterbury. Moreover, it has
            been stated the King attempted to wrestle the Duchy
            of Normandy out of his Brother Robert's hands. Anselm
            abruptly refused to pay and was exiled to Rome where
            he gained the full support of Pope Urban II. In 1100
            Anselm returned to England as Archbishop of
            Canterbury when Henry I came to the throne. Three
            years later, in 1103 Anselm was exiled for the second
            time. Henry I claimed the right to appoint bishops and
            abbots as per his belief in a state controlled Church.
            Anselm ultimately defied Henry I’s views.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between 1103 and 1107 (Second exile) Anselm
            became a pastor and encouraged the ordination of
            native Englishmen among his clergy and staunchly
            opposed slavery. Anselm returned to England in 1107
            and continued his work as Archbishop of Canterbury
            where he spent his final years.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Anselm died aged 76 on Holy Wednesday, 21st
            April 1109, after the conflicts with Henry I had been
            resolved. He had spent his last years ensuring that his
            archbishopric was well-cared for, though he did also
            anathematise those who did not recognise the
            Archbishop of Canterbury’s primacy over the Church in
            England, ensuring that the Church was stable after he
            was dead. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral.
            A later successor to the See of Canterbury, St
            Thomas Becket, requested that Pope Alexander III
            canonise Anselm in 1163.2 It is not known whether he
            was canonised before Becket’s murder, due to a lack of
            extant evidence, though documents from the 15th
            century establish that he was at least considered a
            saint by that point.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result of his theological writings, Pope
            Clement XI declared him to be a Doctor of the Church,
            a title recognising the importance of his work. He is
            known as the ‘Magnificent Doctor’ and the ‘Marian
            Doctor’.
        </p>
        <h3 id="edmund-rice">Edmund Rice</h3>
        <p>
            Edmund Rice was born to Robert Rice and
            Margaret Rice (née Tierney) on the farming property
            of "Westcourt", in Callan, County Kilkenny. He was the
            fourth of seven sons, though he also had two halfsisters, Joan and Jane Murphy, the offspring of his
            mother's first marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edmund was brought up in a heavily Catholic Irish
            background. The boys of the Rice family were mainly
            educated at home by Patrick Grace, a representative
            of the humble community of Augustinian friars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edmund Rice’s grandparents and parents had to
            face a testing trial as a new penal code had been
            enacted over four reigns from 1695 onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Systematically, the ‘disloyal papists’ had been
            deprived of all religious, social and political rights. The
            Laws at the time did not presume an Irish Papist to
            exist, except for the purpose of punishment. During
            the later penal period the disabilities against the
            Catholic religion pressed most heavily on the laity. In
            the words of Lecky, a noted prominent Protestant
            historian, the objective of the penal code was ‘to
            make them poor. . .to degrade them into a servile
            caste.’

            These deprivations had not been fully reversed
            until 1829 with the Catholic Emancipation Act. This Act
            was reluctantly passed by the British Government due
            to the vigorous campaigning by a prominent figure in
            Ireland during the early eighteenth century, Daniel
            O’ Connell.

            The last of the penal laws was enacted in 1746.
            The first act granting relief to Catholics was not passed
            until 1771.

            Edmund belonged to a generation of Catholics
            who had lived under the Penal Code and who were to
            experience, firstly, the relaxation, and then its total
            abolition, through the Catholic Relief Acts of 1782 and
            1791, and subsequently the Catholic Emancipation Act
            of 1829.

            His uncle Michael owned a merchant business in
            the port town of Waterford and Edmund started his
            apprenticeship there in 1779. When Michael died in
            1785, the business was passed on to Edmund.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fervent Catholic who attended daily Mass,
            Edmund became an active member of a society
            established in the city for the relief of the deprived,
            visiting the sick and poor in their homes.

            In 1785, Edmund Rice married his wife, Mary
            Elliot, at the age of 25. Little is known about their
            married life, but in 1789, his wife died following the
            birth of their daughter, Mary Junior, who was born
            prematurely following an accident, and as a
            consequence was severely handicapped. Details of
            the accident are unclear but it was horse-related;
            falling from a horse or being thrown out of a carriage.
        </p>
        <p>
            With family support, Edmund raised his daughter
            for the first 12 years of her life. Still stricken by the
            grief of the loss of his wife, Edmund employed the
            help of his step-sister, Joan, to aid in the rearing of the
            infant. It has been suggested Mary Junior’s disabilities
            had an adverse effect on Edmund’s educational
            leanings. Struggling to cope with the turmoil of these
            circumstances, for answers Rice turned to God, to
            whom he would devote the remainder of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The events were significant in terms of creating
            the man now known as Blessed Edmund Rice.
            Edmund’s personality and devotion
            Edmund threw himself into more prayer and
            charitable work and was considering joining a
            monastery and becoming a monk. The sister of a close
            friends suggested to him, 'Would it not be better to
            devote your life and your wealth to the instruction of
            these neglected children? Might your monastery be in
            the streets?’
            Edmund devoted his life to help with the poor and
            marginalised of Waterford, Ireland. In 1802, when he
            established a makeshift school in a converted stable in
            New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so
            difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This
            prompted him to sell his thriving business to another
            prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and
            devote himself to training teachers who would
            dedicate their lives to prayer and to teaching the
            children, free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes
            were so popular that another temporary school had to
            be set up on another of his properties, this time in
            nearby Stephen Street.
        </p>
        <p>
            The turning point of Rice's ministry was the arrival
            of two young men, Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick
            Finn, from his hometown of Callan. They came to him
            with the desire of joining a congregation, but had not
            decided which they would join. As it turned out, they
            remained to teach at Edmund Rice's school, and later
            formed their own congregation. The subsequent
            success of the New Street school led to a more
            permanent building, christened 'Mount Sion', on
            which construction began on 1 June 1802.
            The founding of ‘Mount Sion’
            From its beginning in 1802, with the founding of a
            night-school, Edmund’s education ministry was
            established. Inspired by years of sorrow and
            sympathy, Edmund went on to educate povertystricken youths in an attempt to fight the injustices of
            the poor; he sought to improve the lives of abandoned
            children with that which he held dearest: God.
            Yet, his passion would not be enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subsequent to the success of the New Street night
            school, Edmund, along with Mr. Grosvenor and
            Mr.Finn, planned the construction of a more
            permanent institution. The construction of ‘Mount
            Sion’ began on the 1st of June 1802. This was to be a
            schoolhouse adjoined to Catholic monastery, a school
            firmly based around Catholicism. After only two years,
            on the 1st of May 1804, Mount Sion was officially
            opened and blessed by Bishop John Power. By 1806 it
            was well established and it encouraged the building of
            various other Catholic schools throughout Ireland.

            Edmund Rice suffered heavily in the last years of
            his life from arthritis, which left him largely confined
            to his room from 1842 onwards. He died at 11 a.m. on
            29th August 1844, and was buried in Waterford.2
            Efforts to begin his cause for sainthood started in
            1911, but the cause was officially opened in Dublin in
            1957. After extensive study, Pope John Paul II declared
            him to be Venerable in 1993. It was two years after
            this that the Pope recognised a miracle connected to
            Edmund. Occurring in 1976, a man who had been
            given 48 hours to live as the result of a gangrenous
            colon, and apparent lack of viable colon tissue, was
            given a relic of Edmund and his family and friends
            prayed for a miracle with Edmund’s intercession,
            offering a Mass for the same purpose. The patient not
            only survived the 48 hours; doctors also discovered a
            considerable length of previously undetected colon.
            He made a recovery within weeks.

            Edmund was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 6th
            October 1996, with his feast day being the 5th May.
